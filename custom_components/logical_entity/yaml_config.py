"""Declarative (YAML) configuration source for Logical Entity (design §6.1,
§6.3).

Domain-key YAML only (`logical_entity:` — see ADR-0007 compliance in design
§6.5): the parsed record list is split by domain and dispatched to each
platform via homeassistant.helpers.discovery.async_load_platform, so no
platform-key YAML (`light: {platform: logical_entity}`) is ever required or
accepted. Reload re-reads the file via
homeassistant.helpers.reload.async_integration_yaml_config (the same helper
template/__init__.py::_reload_config uses, verified in design §2.3/§10.1 R7)
and reconciles running logical entities to it *in place* rather than
unloading and recreating them — see async_reconcile_yaml_logical_entities
docstring for the R7 failure-mode contract this depends on.

**`name` required (PLAT-150) — compatibility for a pre-existing record that
omits it:** `LOGICAL_ENTITY_SCHEMA` now rejects a record with a missing or
blank/whitespace-only `name` as `schema_invalid`, exactly like any other
per-record schema violation — it flows through the same R7 degrade path
(`_validate_records` -> `_RecordError` -> `ISSUE_YAML_RECORD_INVALID` repair
issue) rather than a bespoke migration mechanism. The practical effect
differs by when the record is (re-)evaluated:

* **Live reload** (`logical_entity.reload`, no HA restart) of a logical
  entity that was already running: the record becomes "declared but
  invalid" (`invalid_but_declared` below) and, per R7's last-known-good
  contract, its already-constructed entity is left completely untouched —
  same bound source, same previously-set display name — while the repair
  issue nudges the author to add `name:`. No identity/name change happens
  silently.
* **A cold HA restart** after upgrading past this record's
  `DATA_YAML_LOGICAL_ENTITIES` reset to empty every reconcile, a name-less
  record is invalid from the first evaluation and is simply never
  constructed — no "declared but invalid" carry-forward applies, since
  there is no prior running instance in the same session to preserve. The
  logical entity goes fully unavailable (not "silently renamed"; the
  pre-existing HA entity-registry entry, if any, keeps whatever name was
  last recorded in the registry) with the same repair issue surfaced, until
  `name:` is added and the file reloads/HA restarts again.

Not evidence of a released/versioned config format needing a version-gated
migration: `manifest.json` is pre-1.0, there are no git tags/HACS releases,
and `YAML_SCHEMA_VERSION` (const.py) has never been wired to any actual
migration logic — this repository has no external users to migrate yet.
The R7 degrade-with-repair-issue path above is this integration's existing,
already-tested idiom for exactly this class of "record became invalid under
new code" case, reused here rather than inventing a new one.

**Predeclared, unbound logical entities (PLAT-151) — `source` optional:**
`LOGICAL_ENTITY_SCHEMA` accepts a record with `source: null` or `source`
omitted entirely (both normalize to `None` via the field's `default=None`)
so the complete intended household logical-entity inventory can be declared
in Git — stable `logical_id` and `name` included — before any physical
device is migrated into Home Assistant. This is deliberately *not* the same
code path as an invalid record: an unbound logical entity is a normal,
successfully-validated record (`valid`, never `errors`/`_RecordError`), so
no `ISSUE_YAML_RECORD_INVALID` repair issue is raised for it — predeclaring
is the intended, expected state during migration, not a defect to nudge the
author to fix. It is also a distinct condition from
`ISSUE_UNBOUND`/`ISSUE_UNBOUND_FIXABLE` (entity.py,
`_handle_source_unbound`): those exist specifically to flag that a source
*was bound and then disappeared* — an anomaly worth surfacing in Settings →
Repairs — whereas a predeclared logical entity was simply never bound yet,
which is not an anomaly. Both conditions produce the identical runtime shape
(`LogicalEntity(source_entity_id=None)`, `available=False`) and share every
downstream behavior — availability, capability-contract fallback, hide/
device-association no-ops — see entity.py's `contract_intersect_iterable`/
`contract_intersect_bitmask` and `async_added_to_hass` docstrings/comments.

A predeclared logical entity's `_resolved_source` is `None` like any other
unbound logical entity's, so it flows through
`async_reconcile_yaml_logical_entities`'s existing "Existing: rebind in
place" comparison unchanged: when a later Git commit adds a real `source:`
to an already-declared logical_id, `entity.source_entity_id` (`None`)
differs from the freshly-resolved `record["_resolved_source"]`, so the
already-running entity is rebound via `async_rebind` in place — same
`unique_id`/`entity_id`, no new entity, no consumer-visible identity change
(design §4's stability guarantee, extended to the "never bound yet" starting
state). The reverse — editing `source:` back to `null` on a previously-bound
logical entity — takes the identical comparison branch and unbinds the
running entity the same way, rather than removing it (a logical_id remains
"declared" whether or not its `source` is currently non-null; only a
logical_id genuinely absent from the file is "removed", per the
`declared_logical_ids` comment below).

    because a valid empty declaration — `logical_entity: []` directly, or an
