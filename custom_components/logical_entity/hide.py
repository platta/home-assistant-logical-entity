"""Hide/unhide the wrapped source entity and migrate its voice-assistant
expose settings, mirroring switch_as_x's polish (design §2.1, §7, §10.1 R1).

Hiding uses entity_registry.async_update_entity(hidden_by=...), a long-stable
API verified in the design.

PLAT-128 carry-forward item 3 ("replace or validate the best-effort
expose-settings migration against current supported HA APIs"): the spike's
original implementation guessed at an object-returning
`exposed_entities.async_get(hass)` shape it could not verify. This pass
installed a real, current homeassistant package
(`homeassistant/components/homeassistant/exposed_entities.py`, verified
directly, package version 2025.1.4 — the newest release resolvable in this
sandbox's package index, see the repository README's environment-constraints
note) and read `switch_as_x`'s own `copy_expose_settings` (`switch_as_x/
entity.py::BaseEntity.async_added_to_hass`) as the precedent this integration
already claims to mirror. The real API is a set of module-level functions
taking `hass` explicitly, not an object returned by `async_get`:
`async_get_entity_settings(hass, entity_id) -> dict[str, Mapping[str, Any]]`
(keyed by assistant, e.g. "conversation") and
`async_expose_entity(hass, assistant, entity_id, should_expose)`. There is no
`async_listed_assistants()` method; `switch_as_x` iterates
`async_get_entity_settings(...).items()` directly and skips any assistant
with no explicit `should_expose` recorded — the same approach used below.
The previous guessed shape does not exist on any HA version new enough to
matter and would have silently no-opped via the broad except every time.

The import is still wrapped in try/except ImportError as defense-in-depth
(this remains an internal, non-`__all__`-exported helper module, not a
stable public API), not because this shape is expected to move imminently.
