"""Shared base entity for Logical Entity platform entities.

Implements the mechanisms verified against core in the PLAT-125 design
(switch_as_x / group precedent): state/attribute proxying via
async_track_state_change_event, availability mirroring, service-context
propagation, durable-identity resolution via
entity_registry.async_validate_entity_id (helpers.async_resolve_source_ref),
and — per design §10.1 R3 — a re-entrant command-forwarding guard for
indirect logical-entity→…→logical-entity cycles (direct logical-entity-on-
logical-entity bindings are rejected earlier, at bind-validation time; see
helpers.async_validate_source).

**Rename/removal tracking (PLAT-128 carry-forward item 2)**: `_handle_
registry_event` below is this integration's own registry listener
(`entity_registry.async_track_entity_registry_updated_event` +
`entity_registry.async_validate_entity_id`), not the design-cited
`homeassistant.helpers.helper_integration.async_handle_source_entity_changes`.

**Revision history on this decision:** a first pass claimed
`helper_integration.py` "does not exist" at all, based on a
pip-installed `homeassistant==2025.1.4` package this sandbox's package index
is frozen at (see hide.py's module docstring). `DECISION — ChatGPT`
(PLAT-128, 2026-09-02T16:07 ET) correctly rejected that: the module is real
on current `dev`, modified 2026-08-20. This revision re-verified directly
against a real, current `home-assistant/core` clone (`git clone --branch
dev`, HEAD `f01e29709bc209e54c011affd1f73fdf7a158756`, dated 2026-09-02 —
`git clone` reaches the real repository directly, unconstrained by this
sandbox's frozen pip index) — both `helper_integration.py` and
`switch_as_x/__init__.py` were read in full at that commit, not assumed.

Confirmed, precisely:

- `async_handle_source_entity_changes` is real, current, and genuinely used
  by `switch_as_x/__init__.py::async_setup_entry` today (verified: it wraps
  the whole registry-change lifecycle for that integration's config entry).
- It is **inescapably config-entry-scoped**: `helper_config_entry_id` is a
  required keyword argument, used internally both for
  `hass.config_entries.async_reload(helper_config_entry_id)` and for
  `entity_registry.entities.get_entries_for_config_entry_id(
  helper_config_entry_id)` (`helper_integration.py` lines 63-122). A
  YAML-owned logical entity has no config entry at all — this helper has no
  applicability to that configuration source, full stop, not a matter of
  preference.
- Survive-not-delete on removal (design §8's asymmetry vs. switch_as_x) *is*
  achievable through the helper's own `source_entity_removed` callback —
  its docstring explicitly anticipates "ask the user to select a new source
  entity" as a valid use (line 42-44). The first pass's docstring understated
  this; corrected here. This is not, by itself, a reason to prefer or avoid
  the helper.
- The concrete behavioral cost of adopting it for UI-owned logical entities
  specifically — corrected per `DECISION — ChatGPT` (PLAT-128,
  2026-09-02T16:29 ET): a prior revision of this docstring overstated this
  as "every rename reloads regardless of reference form", which conflated
  the helper's own logic with `switch_as_x`'s particular callback choice.
  What the helper itself actually does (`helper_integration.py`'s
  `async_registry_updated`, the "entity_id" in `data["changes"]` branch) is
  form-dependent: for a **plain entity_id** reference, it calls the
  caller-supplied `set_source_entity_id_or_uuid` callback and does *not*
  itself reload — whether that callback reloads is up to the caller
  (`switch_as_x`'s own callback happens to call
  `hass.config_entries.async_schedule_reload` anyway, but that is
  `switch_as_x`'s choice, not something the helper forces). For a **registry
  UUID** reference, the helper *unconditionally* calls
  `await hass.config_entries.async_reload(helper_config_entry_id)` itself —
  not customizable via callback. This integration's own recommended and
  default persisted form is the UUID (design §6.4: "pin the UUID, because it
  survives entity_id renames unconditionally"), so the helper's
  unconditional-reload path is the one that actually matters for Logical
  Entity's own common case — the practical cost is real, just for the
  UUID-pinned case specifically, not "every rename" as a blanket claim. This
  integration's own `_handle_source_relinked` below instead relinks the
  *same, already-running* entity instance in place for *both* reference
  forms, with no reload at all. Adopting the helper for UI-owned logical
  entities would be a concrete behavioral regression on rename for the
  UUID-pinned (default) case relative to what this integration already does
  and already tests (`tests/test_availability_unbound.py`;
  `_handle_source_relinked`'s own docstring).

Decision: retain this integration's own unified listener for both
configuration sources. The structural reason is the strongest one: the
helper's mandatory config-entry-scoping means it can never serve a
YAML-owned logical entity, so adopting it only for UI-owned logical entities
would introduce exactly the source-conditional runtime behavior design
§10.3 names as a design smell ("every behavioral rule is defined on the
logical entity record, never on its configuration source") — a UI-owned
logical entity bound by this integration's own default (UUID) reference
form would reload on every rename while a YAML-owned logical entity, on the
identical event, would not. The compatibility burden accepted by not
adopting it: this integration keeps maintaining its own registry-event
handling rather than inheriting future core-side fixes/improvements to the
shared helper, mitigated the same way the design's own risk register
already covers general helper-API churn (R22) — CI against both HA
`stable` and `dev`.

**Device linkage (PLAT-130, design §4):** implemented below as
`_sync_device_link`, called from every path that can change what a logical
entity is bound to (initial bind in `async_added_to_hass`, `async_rebind`,
`_handle_source_relinked`, and the device-only branch of
`_handle_registry_event`) — not via the add-time `device_info`/
`device_entry` mechanism `switch_as_x`'s own `BaseEntity.__init__` uses.
Verified directly against a real, current `home-assistant/core` `dev` clone
(`git clone --depth 1 --branch dev`, fetched 2026-09-02):
`helpers/entity_platform.py::EntityPlatform._async_add_entity` only honors
`entity.device_info`/`entity.device_entry` when `self.config_entry` is set —
for any entity added without one (`_check_device_attach`, lines ~839-852) it
silently forces `device_entry = None` and logs a deprecation report instead.
Every YAML-owned logical entity goes through exactly that no-config-entry
path (`discovery.async_load_platform`, design §6.1), so the add-time
mechanism cannot serve both configuration sources uniformly — using it
would be precisely the source-conditional behavior design §10.3 calls a
smell.

`entity_registry.async_update_entity(entity_id, device_id=...)` has no such
restriction: `_validate_item` only checks that the target device exists, not
that the entity has a config entry. That is also the exact call
`helper_integration.async_handle_source_entity_changes` itself uses to
relink on a source device move — so this integration mirrors that one
mechanic (a plain post-hoc registry write) behind its own unified,
source-agnostic call site, rather than adopting the whole config-entry-scoped
helper, per this ticket's own instruction. The logical entity's own registry
entry starts with `device_id=None` at construction (LogicalEntity never sets
`device_entry`/`device_info`) and is promoted/demoted afterward by
`_sync_device_link` alone — for both configuration sources, through the same
code path, so it is inherently symmetric rather than something that must be
kept in sync by hand. The logical entity never creates or owns a device:
every write either points at an already-existing device the source itself
belongs to, or clears the link to `None`.

        carry-forward finding.

        Only affects first-time registration: `entity_registry.async_get_or_
        create` looks up an *existing* entry by `unique_id` before ever
        consulting this property, so a logical entity's entity_id — once
        assigned — stays fixed across every later reconcile/rebind
        regardless of this override (design §4's stability guarantee is
        otherwise untouched).

        Why this matters *because of* PLAT-150 specifically: before `name`
        was required, every YAML record without one fell back to
        `name = logical_id` (see the removed `record.get("name", record[
        CONF_LOGICAL_ID])` in each platform's `from_yaml_record`), which
        meant `suggested_object_id`'s stock name-derived slug coincidentally
        equaled `logical_id` in practice for every record this suite's own
        fixtures ever exercised (e.g. `name: "Kitchen Counter"` already
        slugifies back to `logical_id: kitchen_counter`). With `name` now a
        genuinely independent, human-chosen string, a differently-worded
        `name` (e.g. `logical_id: office_light`, `name: "Family Room
        Light"`) would otherwise register under `light.family_room_light`
        on first creation instead of the author-declared
        `light.office_light` — breaking design §4's "YAML-owned logical
        entity: an author-declared logical_id slug" identity guarantee and
        the Git-managed-determinism promise (design §6.3: "bindings
        converge to Git with no dependence on .storage") this integration's
        own tests already assert (see tests/test_identity.py). Only the
        YAML construction path (`from_yaml_record` classmethods) passes
        `object_id`; the UI/config-entry path deliberately keeps deriving
        the object id from the user-entered name, as it always has — a
        config-entry logical entity's `logical_id` is `entry.entry_id` (an
        opaque UUID), never meant to appear in an entity_id.
