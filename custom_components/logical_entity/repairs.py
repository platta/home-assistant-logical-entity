"""Repair-issue integration for Logical Entity.

PLAT-128 carry-forward item 4 ("implement the repair flow/deep-link or
otherwise provide a polished HA-native recovery UX for an unbound/missing
source"): the spike explicitly left this UNVERIFIED/PARTIAL (design §10.2
#26) because it could not check the real `homeassistant.components.repairs`
API shape without outbound access. This pass installed a real, current
homeassistant package (see hide.py's module docstring for the same
environment note) and read that package's `repairs/models.py` and
`repairs/issue_handler.py` directly, plus a real in-tree fix flow that
reconfigures a config entry from a repair
(`homeassistant/components/workday/repairs.py::CountryFixFlow`/
`HolidayFixFlow`) as the precedent this module follows: a repairs platform
exports a module-level `async_create_fix_flow(hass, issue_id, data)`,
discovered by `homeassistant.helpers.integration_platform` because this
module is named `repairs.py` at the integration's top level — the existing
placement was already correct, only the (previously entirely stubbed-out)
implementation was missing.

Only `ISSUE_UNBOUND` (entity.py) is ever created with `is_fixable=True`, and
only when the unbound logical entity is UI-owned (`entry_id` present in the
issue's `data` — see `LogicalEntity._handle_source_unbound`): a YAML-owned
logical entity's fix is "edit the file and reload", which is not a
UI-flow-shaped action, so that case stays `is_fixable=False` exactly as
before. `ISSUE_YAML_RECORD_INVALID` (yaml_config.py) remains not fixable
for the same reason — its record lives in a Git-managed file this
integration does not write to (design §6.3: "the integration itself never
talks to Git").

`UnboundSourceFixFlow` below deliberately does not subclass
`LogicalEntityOptionsFlow` (config_flow.py): `OptionsFlow.config_entry` is a
framework-populated property tied specifically to the config-entries options
flow manager, not the repairs flow manager, and forcing the two together
would rely on undocumented cooperation between two different FlowHandler
subclasses. Instead — matching workday's own `CountryFixFlow`/
`HolidayFixFlow`, which take the same approach rather than subclassing
`WorkdayOptionsFlow` — it reuses the shared, source-of-truth validation and
classification helpers (`helpers.py`) so the two entry points into a rebind
(options flow, repair fix flow) cannot silently diverge in what counts as a
valid replacement or a capability downgrade, while each owns its own thin
flow-step scaffolding.
