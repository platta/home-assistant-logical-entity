"""Shared helpers: source resolution, bind-time validation, contract seeding.

Source entities are referenced by entity-registry UUID wherever the config
flow persists them, resolved fresh via entity_registry.async_validate_entity_id
at every setup/rebind — the switch_as_x pattern verified in the PLAT-125
design (§2.1/§4): that helper accepts either an entity_id or a registry UUID
and always returns the entity's *current* entity_id, so a UUID-pinned
reference survives a rename (including one that happened while HA was down)
while a plain entity_id reference breaks at the next reload — the documented
trade-off in design §6.4, not a bug.
