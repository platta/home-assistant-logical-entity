    integration's entities are added. This test harness's `hass` fixture
    does *not* do that bootstrap step, unlike real HA. Without it,
    `hass.data[DATA_EXPOSED_ENTITIES]` (owned by this domain, per

    missing, and `LogicalEntity._apply_hide_source_policy`'s call into

    KeyError that (confirmed directly, PLAT-128) silently fails the whole
    entity add inside HA's own entity_platform — not a "migration skipped,
    everything else fine" degrade. Setting this up here matches real-world
    guarantees rather than adding a defensive fallback in production code for
    a condition that cannot occur outside this kind of minimal test harness.
