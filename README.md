# Logical Entity

A [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) custom integration that gives you a
**stable logical entity** — `light.kitchen_counter`, say — that keeps its identity (entity ID and
unique ID) for life, no matter what physical device is currently behind it.

Replace a dead bulb, swap a Zigbee plug for a Matter one, or move a contact sensor to different
hardware, and every automation, scene, and dashboard card that references the logical entity keeps
working — untouched. HomeKit accessory identity is *designed* to derive from that same stable
unique ID (Home Assistant's own HomeKit bridge keys accessories on it), so a logical entity is
expected to carry its Apple Home accessory across a hardware swap the same way — but that specific
claim has **not** been validated against a real Apple Home client yet; see the status note below.

## What it does

- **Create a logical entity** for a light, switch/outlet, or contact (binary) sensor through Home
  Assistant's normal Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers UI — pick the domain, name it, and
  point it at the hardware entity it should currently proxy.
- **Replace hardware** at any time through the logical entity's own Configure → Options flow. Its
  identity never changes; consumers see a brief state refresh, nothing more.
- It advertises **`capability contract ∩ current hardware`** — you declare what the logical entity
  promises (e.g. "this light supports color"), and it only ever exposes what both the contract
  *and* the currently-bound hardware actually support. A downgrade (swapping in simpler hardware)
  asks for confirmation and narrows the advertised capabilities; an upgrade stays inert until you
  widen the contract yourself.
- If the bound hardware is removed, **the logical entity survives** — it goes unavailable and
  raises a repair notification, rather than disappearing. Bind replacement hardware whenever
  you're ready.
- Everything above works with **zero Git/YAML/automation knowledge required**. A normal
  Home-Assistant user never has to see anything but the standard Helpers UI.

## Advanced: declarative (YAML) configuration

For deployments that manage Home Assistant configuration as code, logical entities can instead be
declared under a domain-key `logical_entity:` block and reloaded without restarting HA via the
`logical_entity.reload` service — the same dual-path pattern Home Assistant's own `template`
integration uses. A logical entity is owned by exactly one source (UI *or* YAML, never both);
nothing about the declarative path is visible anywhere in the UI-only experience above.

Each declared logical entity has three distinct identities. `logical_id` and `name` are always
required; `capability_contract`, `device_class`, and `hide_source` are optional; `source` is
required to be *present in the schema* but its value may be `null` (or the key omitted) to
predeclare a logical entity with no hardware bound yet — see
[Predeclared, unbound logical entities](#predeclared-unbound-logical-entities) below.

- `logical_id` — the durable *machine* identity (the slug behind the entity's
  `unique_id`/`entity_id`).
- `name` — the durable *human-facing* identity (what you and Home Assistant's UI actually call the
  logical entity). Required, and must not be blank/whitespace-only — it is never derived from
  `logical_id` or from the bound hardware, so replacing the hardware behind a logical entity never
  changes what it's called.
- `source` — the *replaceable physical implementation* currently bound to the logical entity (an
  `entity_id`, or, recommended for Git-managed deployments, an entity-registry UUID — see the
  design), or `null` if it is not yet bound to anything.

```yaml
logical_entity:
  - logical_id: kitchen_counter
    domain: light
    source: light.nanoleaf_a19_kitchen   # entity_id, or (recommended for Git-managed
                                          # deployments) an entity-registry UUID — see the design
    name: Kitchen Counter
    capability_contract:
      supported_color_modes: [hs, color_temp]
      supported_features: 0
    hide_source: true
```

A record missing `name`, or whose `name` is blank/whitespace-only, fails validation with a repair
issue (Settings → Repairs) rather than falling back to `logical_id` or being silently accepted —
see `yaml_config.py`'s module docstring for the exact compatibility behavior for a logical entity
that already existed before `name` became required.

An empty declaration — `logical_entity: []`, or an `!include` pointing at a file that is empty
or contains only comments — is valid and means zero YAML-owned logical entities; it will not fail
HA startup. This is the expected state for a fresh GitOps install or a recovery/bootstrap checkout
before any household logical entities have been declared yet.

### Predeclared, unbound logical entities

A logical entity's `source` may be `null` (or simply omitted), letting you declare the household's
complete intended logical-entity inventory in Git before any of the physical devices behind it
have been migrated into Home Assistant:

```yaml
logical_entity:
  - logical_id: office_ceiling
    domain: light
    name: Office Ceiling
    source: null
    capability_contract:
      supported_color_modes: [color_temp, hs]
```

An unbound logical entity still registers with its declared `logical_id` and `name` —
dashboards, automations, and HomeKit can already reference it — but shows as **unavailable** until
a source is bound. It does *not* raise a repair issue: predeclaring is the expected, intended
state during a migration, unlike a logical entity whose previously-bound source disappeared (see
[Recovering an unbound logical entity](#recovering-an-unbound-logical-entity) below, a genuinely
different condition).

While unbound, a logical entity advertises its **declared `capability_contract` directly** (not
intersected against any hardware, since there is none yet) — so the intended capabilities are
visible up front rather than collapsing to nothing. `hide_source` and device-association are
no-ops until a source exists (there is nothing to hide or link to).

Migrating a device onto a predeclared logical entity is a one-line Git change — add or update its
`source:` — followed by `logical_entity.reload` (or a normal HA restart). Reconciliation binds the
already-existing logical entity to the physical source **in place**: identity
(`unique_id`/`entity_id`) never changes, so nothing downstream needs to reference a new entity.
The same applies in reverse — setting `source:` back to `null` unbinds the logical entity
(returning it to unavailable) without removing it; only a `logical_id` genuinely absent from the
file is removed.

## Recovering an unbound logical entity

If a logical entity's bound hardware is removed from Home Assistant, it survives unavailable and
raises a repair issue (Settings → Repairs). Selecting **Fix** on that issue opens the same
"pick a replacement" step as its own Configure → Options flow, directly from the repair — no need
to separately find it first.

## Supported domains (v1)

`light`, `switch` (including the `outlet` device class), `binary_sensor` (e.g. `door`/`window`).

## Design

This integration implements the accepted design
`PLAT-125-hardware-role-abstraction-design.md` (Plattsoft `gitops` repository,
merge commit `af668725e9c632b12ba9c7dfc7c4e83df631250c`). That document is the authoritative
architecture reference and still uses the original "Entity Role" naming; see
`docs/PLAT-220-rename-to-logical-entity.md` for the terminology mapping this repository applies on
top of it. `docs/PLAT-126-spike-results.md` records the initial bounded spike's gate-by-gate
results; `docs/PLAT-128-production-results.md` records the production pass — including two
verified decisions to retain the spike's manual config-flow base classes and custom
source-tracking listener rather than adopt newer core helpers cited in the design, with the
evidence behind each. Both were carried over unmodified in substance from `home-assistant-entity-role`.

## HACS status

Not yet claimed HACS-ready. CI confirms `hassfest` and the test suite (HA stable + dev) green;
**HACS validation currently fails**, and confirmed (this repository's own first CI run, PR #1) to
fail only on repository-publication metadata this integration's own code cannot set: "The
repository has no description" and "The repository has no valid topics". Setting a description
and topics (`home-assistant`, `hacs-integration`, `custom-integration`, `home-automation`) via
repository Settings or `gh repo edit` — outside what a repository-scoped `git push` can do, and
outside this session's own permissions (`gh repo edit`/`gh api` were denied) — would resolve this;
this is the identical metadata-gated finding `docs/PLAT-128-production-results.md` recorded for
the source repository, carried forward unchanged by this rename.

## Installation

Via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) as a custom repository (`platta/home-assistant-logical-entity`,
category "Integration"), or manually by copying `custom_components/logical_entity/` into your
Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory and restarting.

## Development

```console
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements_test.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

CI runs `hassfest`, HACS validation, and the test suite against both the current stable and the
`dev` (RC) branch of Home Assistant core — always resolving genuinely current package releases.
A local sandboxed dev environment's package index may be frozen well behind the real PyPI/GitHub
state (observed directly during PLAT-128, on the source repository: a `pip install homeassistant`
with no version pin resolved no newer than a `2025.1.4` release from one such index, versus CI
correctly resolving the real current stable/dev releases) — treat CI, not a local install's
version, as the authority on "current supported HA APIs" if the two ever disagree.
